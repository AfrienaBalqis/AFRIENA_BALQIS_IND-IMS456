                        <p>"Girl in Pieces" is my favorite book because it provides a raw and authentic portrayal of trauma, resilience, and the journey toward healing. Charlie Davis's story of overcoming immense pain and adversity resonates deeply with me, capturing the complexity of mental health struggles with compassion and honesty.

                        <p>"A Good Bad Mother" is my comfort drama because it beautifully portrays the complexities of parent-child relationships and the transformative power of love and forgiveness. The journey of Young-soon and Kang-ho, from a strained relationship to a heartwarming reconnection, resonates deeply with me. The drama's blend of emotional depth, touching moments, and themes of family bonds offer a sense of warmth and reassurance, making it a perfect escape and a source of comfort.</p>
